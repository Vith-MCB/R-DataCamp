# R-DataCamp
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the DataCamp R courses! 🎉
This repository contains a series of R code examples that I developed while completing various DataCamp courses.  👨‍💻

As a solo developer, I found it helpful to have a repository where I could store and organize all of the code I wrote during the courses. I decided to make this repository available publicly so that other learners who are interested in R and DataCamp can benefit from the code examples and use them to practice and improve their R programming skills.  

Please note that this repository does not include any explanations or tutorials on how to use the code. It is meant to be a collection of code examples that learners can use to practice and experiment with R programming concepts. If you have any questions or feedback on the code examples, please feel free to reach out to me through GitHub.
